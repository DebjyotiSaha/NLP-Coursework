To demonstrate the outline of the individual coursework, I have divided the zip file into 2 different components:
	1. NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha
	2. Intent Chatbot Sample

First run the, "NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha.ipynb" file

1. NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha
	- The zip file contains 2 things, (.ipynb) file & Intent Chatbot Sample. To go through the outline of the
	individual coursework please execute the python file named as, "NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha.ipynb".

2. Intent Chatbot Sample
	- This folder contains 5 items. The json file is the dataset of the file. The remaining files are (.py) files as while converting those to (.ipynb)
	the libraries weren't working properly. The execution of the folder Intent Chatbot Sample is given inside the folder.


** The overall submission contains: -
	1. NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha (Outside zip)
	2. NLP Coursework (Intent Classification)- Debjyoti Saha.ipynb (Inside zip)
	3. Intent Chatbot Sample (Inside zip)

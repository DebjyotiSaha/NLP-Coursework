# NLP-Coursework
### To execute the files ###

1. First put all the files in the same directory including the dataset.
2. If you laptop/PC is not compatible then kindly install virtual environment.
3. When all the files are in same directory, execute the, 'nltk_utils' files.
4. After the first execution, run the, 'model.py' file which consist of a feed forward neural network.
5. When the model is executed successfully, just to see the accuracy we will train dataset through the 'train.py' file.
6. When the execution ends, we can see epochs values and a file named as 'data.pth' will be created in your current directory.
7. The final step is to execute 'chat.py' file in command prompt, and the chatbot is started.

### I will further upload the file details in a document file later. - Debjyoti Saha ###

Added a JPYNB file which has all the files .

made a few changes in code (1 or 2)


Some things to download to get it to run (pip install )

nltk,torch,ipywidgets 


In jypynb added a last sell to just delete the data.pth from local directry to keep everything organized
